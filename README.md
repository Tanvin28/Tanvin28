- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Tanvin28
- I am highly interested in data and what they can reveal about ourselves and everything around us. Beceause numbers never lie!!! I am also an enthusiast when it comes to creating games. 
- I am currently learning python, C# and unity (Have couple of months of experience and eager to learn a lot more).
- I am always looking forward to collaborate on any fun data science or game projects because I believe working on real life problems is the only way to learn efficiently.
